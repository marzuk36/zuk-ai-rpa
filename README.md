## 📄 Legal Contract Review – NER + Compliance

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
Assist legal and compliance teams in reviewing contracts by detecting missing clauses and extracting key information automatically.

### ⚙️ **How It Works**
- Uses the pretrained BERT-based NER model [`dslim/bert-base-NER`](https://huggingface.co/dslim/bert-base-NER) to extract:
  - **Persons**, **Organizations**, **Locations**, and **Dates**
- Performs rule-based clause detection using regex to find:
  - **Governing Law**, **Confidentiality**, **Termination**, **Payment Terms**, **Indemnity**
- Flags missing clauses as potential risks
- Displays a compliance checklist and calculates a risk score
- Includes **mock RPA buttons** (e.g., “Send for Legal Review”, “Auto-File”) to simulate downstream automation

### ✅ **Example Use Case**  
<sub>LegalOps teams can use this tool as a first-pass triage to prioritize contracts for deeper review, ensuring key clauses are present.</sub>

## 📧 Email Prioritization Assistant

### 🎯 **Purpose**  
Help client servicing teams triage emails more efficiently based on intent, urgency, and sentiment.

### ⚙️ **How It Works**
- Performs intent classification using simple NLP logic
- Detects urgency using keywords like **"urgent"**, **"ASAP"**, etc.
- Runs sentiment analysis using **TextBlob**
- Labels each email with:
  - **Intent** (e.g., Complaint, Request)
  - **Urgency** (High / Normal)
  - **Sentiment** (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- Generates a **priority tag** to assist fast decision-making

### ✅ **Example Use Case**  
<sub>Support teams can auto-prioritize high-risk or time-sensitive emails, improving response times and SLA compliance.</sub>
